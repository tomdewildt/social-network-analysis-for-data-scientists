## Why are these questions suitable for collecting network data?

### These questions are suitable for collecting network data, because they
### capture the connections (edges) between students (vertices) in the class.
### Additionally they capture the strength of the edges by asking how often
### two students communicate.

## Which question collects what kind of data?

### The general questions in the first part of questionnaire capture vertex
### attributes. The questions about who you interact with the most capture the
### edges and the questions about how often you interact with that person and if
### consider this person your friend capture edge attributes or edge strength.

## What could be a bias for this data collection?

### True level of friendship is hard to quantify. You have to select a fixed
### number friends even though you might have relationships with more people.

## What are the possible ethical concerns that might arise?

### Asking questions about personal relationships could be morally questionable.
